chapter 1
hello (about light)
-----------------------------------------------------------
light is a rehash of milkyway (https://github.com/milkywaygg/milkywaygg.github.io), and i'm redoing this because i hated:
- the design of the site overall
- how there were no preview images for games, just the buttons (SHIT navigating!!!!!!)
- how the files were so unorganized (and for example, ~40 repositories depending on each other for the entire site to function instead of all-in-one)
(i'm not joking, check the milkyway org)
and i was really getting tired of the branding in general.
as the name suggests, this site meant to be lightweight and simple but it will be large in terms of quantity
this started on october 12, 2025, and i want to get all the games and apps/tools moved by maybe october 24
i should be able to finish within that time
in the meantime i will keep milkyway up, but once this is finished, that will go down. i will set an announcement on milkyway as well
ðŸ«¡ enjoy

these are useful

ESCAPE
when you are on any game or on the light menu you can hit the (,) key to escape
what is escape?
when you first choose escape you can select a link you will be taken to once that key is pressed again
and the link will always save
you can change it by hitting ctrl+shift+r on the site (careful as this will wipe all your data) 
yes ik it is a bad solution but im looking for another option to reset it


CLOAKER
also on any game or on the light menu you can hit the (.) key to open the cloaker
what is cloaker?
hitting the cloaker key will open a dialogue and you will be given options to choose from a variety of stuff:

- ALEKS
- Clever
- Cool Math Games
- Desmos
- Edpuzzle
- Google
- Google Drive
- Google Classroom
- Google Docs
- Google Slides
- IXL
- i-Ready (Reading)
- i-Ready (Math)
- Khan Academy
- Naviance
- PowerSchool
- Schoology

and your tab will be disguised to look like whatever you choose
im working on a settings option in the menu so that this saves across all pages instead of having to hit the key everytime
